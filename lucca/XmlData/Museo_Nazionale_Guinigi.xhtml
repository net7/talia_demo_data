        <h2>Giunigi National Museum</h2>
        <p>
            The villa was built in 1414 by Paolo Guinigi; it is an imposing brick construction surrounded by a big garden. The villa passed to the Reppublica lucchese in 1430. After many changes the place became a civic museum in 1924. After the WW2 it was renovated and in 1968 the civic museum became a national museum. The museum shows the historic-artistic past of Lucca. There is a collection of archaeological piece from Etruscan and Roman times and a collection of sculptures and paintings from the medieval times and the baroque. There's also a collection of clerical furniture and fabrics.
