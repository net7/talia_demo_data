        <h2>Guinigi Tower</h2>
        <p>
            The Guinigi Tower, one of the few towers left standing in the city, is one of the most representative monuments of Lucca. Its most unusual feature is the enormous holm-oak that stands on top of it. In the early 14th century - when it laid inside a much smaller enceinte than the present one - Lucca was extremely proud of its many towers and campanili. As masters of the city, the Guinigi decided to embellish their austere residences with a tower planted with trees, as a symbol of rebirth and of the power they wielded. It was the wish of the last descendant of the family that the tree-tower and the building in Via Sant'Andrea should become the property of the City of Lucca.
