        <h2>Guinigi Era</h2>
        <p>
            On the 21st November of 1400 <i>Paolo Guinigi</i> was elected Lord of Lucca, after many clashes between the house of Guinigi (favoured by the people) and the house of Forteguerra (supported by the big merchants).

            n 1408, Lucca hosted the convocation intended to end the schism in the papacy. Occupied by the troops of Louis of Bavaria, the city was sold to a rich Genoese, Gherardino Spinola, then seized by John, king of Bohemia. Pawned to the Rossi of Parma, by them it was ceded to Martino della Scala of Verona, sold to the Florentines, surrendered to the Pisans, and then nominally liberated by the emperor Charles IV and governed by his vicar. Lucca managed, at first as a democracy, and after 1628 as an oligarchy, to maintain its independence alongside of Venice and Genoa, and painted the word Libertas on its banner until the French Revolution in 1789.[2].
