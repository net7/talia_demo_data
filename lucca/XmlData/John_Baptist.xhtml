        <h2>John the Baptist</h2>
        <p>
            Saint John the Baptist (also called John the Baptizer) was a 1st century Jewish preacher and ascetic regarded as a prophet by four religions: Christianity, Islam, Mandaeanism and the Bahá'í Faith. The title of prophet is asserted in the Synoptic Gospels, the Qur'an, the Bahá'í writings and the Book of Mormon. He is commonly referred to as John the Forerunner or Precursor by Christians who consider him the forerunner of Jesus Christ.
