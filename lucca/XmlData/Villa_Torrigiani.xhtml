        <p>
            Villa Torrigiani is located in Camigliano close to Lucca. Dating back to the 16th century, it's one of the most luxurious and scenic of the lucchese villas.

            The villa is first mentioned in 1593 as belonging to the Buonvisi family. It was then acquired by Nicola Santini who at the end of the 16h century had the south facade reconstructed in baroque style. The style was probably influenced by the architecture of Versailles who he was an ambassador for the Lucchese Republic.

            In 1816 Vittoria Santini married Pietro Guadagni who took the mother's nome <i>Torrigiani</i> to inherit the family property and title, since the old Florentine family was without male heirs.
