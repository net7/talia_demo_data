        <h2>Lucca - a Talia demo application</h2>
        <img src="Lucca-discovery.jpg" alt="Discovery Logo"/>
        <p>
            Welcome to Talia. This demo contains a sample library with some
            information about the city of Lucca. Of course there's still a lot
            missing, but you can already take a first look.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the page about Lucca. Lucca is a city in Tuscany, northern central Italy, situated on the river Serchio in a fertile plain near (but not on) the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Lucca. Among other reasons, it is famous for its intact Renaissance-era city walls (although the city has expanded beyond the wall's boundaries).

        <h3>What can you do here?</h3>
        <p>
            On the left of your screen you will see the <b>sidebar</b>. This
            area contains the tools to navigate the database. You can collapse
            the sidebar by clicking the arrow button. Clicking again will 
            restore it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently the sidebar has two navigation mechanisms: When you view
            a Source, it will show the content related to it. Or you can 
            click the "house" button to navigate through the ontology of
            our demo - showing the types of elements contained in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you click the "document" icon, you will go back to viewing 
            Sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of this text, to the right, you will see the <b>toolbar</b>.
            In the final version of Talia, this will contain tools to work 
            with the Source that you are looking at.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment it just contains two example buttons, one of which
            will take you back to this start page.
        </p>
