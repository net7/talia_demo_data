            Palazzo Mansi is the seat of the Pinacoteca Nazional (a national museum) and is one of the greatest manors of Lucca.
            The core was constructed in the XVI and XVII century. The decorations were completed in the 
            seventeenth century. In the 18th century, further additions were made.
