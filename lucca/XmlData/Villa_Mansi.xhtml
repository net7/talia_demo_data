        <h2>Villa Mansi</h2>
        <p>
            Villa Mansi is one of the most famous of the luccanese villas. It's located in Segromigno in Monte, a part of Capannori in the province of Lucca.

            The villa has a beautiful facade in Mannerist style, augmented by the free view from great lawn in front of the villa.

            The villa was built in 1599 by the Benedetti family. The original villa was a rectangular, simple building with a central salon above which the other rooms were located.

            In 1634 the architect Muzio Oddi restructured the villa in french baroque style, at the request of Paolo Cenami.

            The facade was created in the 18th century.
