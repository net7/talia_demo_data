The Sublime Ottoman State was an empire that lasted
from 1299 to 1923.

At the height of its power, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the empire spanned three
continents, controlling much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. The
Ottoman Empire contained 29 provinces and numerous vassal states, some of which were later absorbed
into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.
The empire also temporarily gained authority over distant overseas lands through declarations of
allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and Caliph, such as the declaration by the Sultan of Aceh in 1565;
or through the temporary acquisitions of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, such as Lanzarote in
1585.

The empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six
centuries. With Constantinople as its capital city, and vast control of lands around the
eastern Mediterranean during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (ruled 1520 to 1566), the Ottoman
Empire was, in many respects, an Islamic successor to the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.
The Ottoman Empire came to an end, as a regime under an imperial monarchy, on November 1, 1922.
It formally ended, as a de jure state, on July 24, 1923, under the Treaty of Lausanne. It was
succeeded by the Republic of Turkey which was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923.
The empire was also known in English as the Osmanic Empire, the Osmanian Empire or the Ottoman
State. Many contemporaries referred to it as the Turkish Empire or simply Turkey (see the other
names of the Ottoman State).
