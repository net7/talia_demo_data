<p><span>Al Aqsa Mosque (“the farthest mosque”) is an Islamic holy place in the Old City of Jerusalem. The site that includes the mosque and the Dome of the Rock is usually referred to al-Haram al-Sharif (“Sacred Noble Santuary”). It is widely considered as the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. al-Aqsa Mosque was originally a small prayer house, but was rebuilt and expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and finished by his son al-Walid in 705 CE. The mosque was destroyed by earthquakes twice and many renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries. Today, while the Old City of Jerusalem is under Israeli control, the mosque remains under the administration of the Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf. </span></p><p><span>Muslims be</span><span>lieve that the prophet Muhammad was transported by Buraq, a miraculous steed from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to al-Aqsa Mosque during the night journey.
