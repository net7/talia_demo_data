An ancient town, it is the seat of an archbishop, but is now best known as "the capital of engines",
since the factories of the famous Italian sports car makers Ferrari, De Tomaso, Lamborghini, Pagani
and Maserati are, or were, located here and all, except Lamborghini, have headquarters in the city
or nearby. Lamborghini is headquartered not far away in Sant'Agata Bolognese, in the adjacent
Province of Bologna. One of Ferrari's cars, the 360 Modena, was named after the town itself. Also,
one of the colors for Ferraris is Modena yellow.
