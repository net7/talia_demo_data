Byzantine art is the term commonly used to describe the artistic products of the Byzantine Empire
from about the 4th century until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453.

The term can also be used for the art of Eastern Orthodox states which were contemporary with the
Byzantine Empire and were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the
"Byzantine commonwealth"), such as Bulgaria, Serbia, or Rus and also for the art of the Republic of
Venice and Kingdom of Sicily, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other
respects part of western European culture. Art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the
Ottoman Empire is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the
Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in
Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.
