<p><span>The Dome of the Rock (Masjid Qubbat As-Sakhrah) is an Islamic shrine and major landmark located on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It was completed in 691-692, making it the oldest existing Islamic building in the world. Umayyad Caliph Abd al Malik who initiated the construction of the Dome intended the building to serve as a shrine for pilgrims and not as a mosque for public worship. Historians contend that the Caliph tried to create a structure which would compete with the existing buildings of other religions in the city. Its form of a rotunda, although it was foreign to Islam, attempted to rival the many Christian domes of its time. The structure is basically octagonal. It comprises a wooden dome, which is mounted on an elevated drum consisting of a circle of 16 piers and columns. Surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns. The outer side walls are made of porcelain. The Dome is in the shape of a Byzantine martyrium, a structure intended for the housing and veneration of saintly relics, and is an excellent example of middle Byzantine art. During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificant the exterior of the Dome of the Rock was covered with Iznik tiles. In 1955 an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of Jordan, with funds supplied by the Arab governments and Turkey. In 1960, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable aluminum and bronze alloy made in Italy. In 1998 the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of $8.2 million by King Hussein of Jordan who fund the 80 kilograms of gold required. The interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic, faience and marble, much of which was added several centuries after its completion. It also contains Qur'anic inscriptions. During the Crusedes the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104. Jerusalem was recaptured by Saladin on 2 October 1187, and the Haram was reconsecrated as a Muslim sanctuary. </span></p><p><span>According to Islamic tradition, the rock is the spot from where Muhammad ascended to Heaven accompanied by the angel Gabriel.</span></p>
