The Great Mosque of Samarra is a 9th century mosque which is located in the Iraqi city of Samarra.
The mosque was commissioned in 848 and completed in 851 by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil who
reigned (in Samarra) from 847 until 861.

The Great Mosque of Samarra was at one time the largest mosque in the world; its minaret, the
Malwiya Tower, is a vast spiralling cone (snail shaped) 52 meters high and 33 meters wide with a
spiral ramp.
The mosque had 17 aisles, and its walls were panelled with mosaics of dark blue glass. It was part
of an extension of Samarra eastwards.

On April 1, 2005, the top of the Malwiya minaret was damaged by a bomb. Insurgents reportedly
attacked the tower because U.S. troops had been using it as a lookout position. The blast removed
pieces of brick from the top of the minaret along its spiral ramp.
The art and architecture of the mosque was influential; stucco carvings within the mosque in floral
and geometric designs represent early Islamic decoration. Additionally, the mosque of Ibn Tulun in
Cairo, Egypt was based on the Samarra mosque in many regards.
