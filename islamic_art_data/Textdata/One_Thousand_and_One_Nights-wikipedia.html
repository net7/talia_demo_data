One Thousand and One Nights is a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales
compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian
Nights, from the first English language edition (1706), which rendered the title as The Arabian
Nights' Entertainment.

The work as we have it was collected over many centuries by various authors, translators and
scholars across the Middle East and North Africa. The tales themselves trace their roots back to
ancient and medieval Arabic, Persian, Indian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian folklore and literature. In
particular, many tales were originally folk stories from the Caliphate era, while others, especially
the frame story, are most probably drawn from the Pahlavi Persian work Hazar Afsan which in turn relied partly on Indian elements. Though the oldest
Arabic manuscript dates from the 14th century, scholarship generally dates the collection's genesis
to around the 9th century.

What is common throughout all the editions of the Nights is the initial frame story of the ruler
Shahryar and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated
throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within
other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few
hundred nights, while others include 1,001 or more.
Some of the best-known stories of The Nights, particularly "Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp", "Ali Baba and
the Forty Thieves" and "The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor", while almost certainly genuine
Middle-Eastern folk tales, were not part of The Nights in Arabic versions, but were interpolated
into the collection by Antoine Galland and other European translators.
