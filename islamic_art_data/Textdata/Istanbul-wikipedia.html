Istanbul is also a megacity, as well as the cultural,
economic, and financial centre of Turkey. The city covers 39 districts of the Istanbul province.
It is located on the Bosphorus Strait and encompasses the natural harbour known as the Golden Horn,
in the northwest of the country. It extends both on the European (Thrace) and on the Asian
(Anatolia) sides of the Bosphorus, and is thereby the only metropolis in the world that is situated
on two continents. Istanbul is a designated alpha world city.
In its long history, the city has served as the capital city of the Roman Empire (330–395), the
Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire (395–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin Empire (1204–1261), and the
Ottoman Empire (1453–1922). The city was chosen as joint European Capital of Culture for 2010.
Historic areas of Istanbul were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1985.
