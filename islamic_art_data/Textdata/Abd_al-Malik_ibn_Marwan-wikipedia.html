Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (646-705) was the 5th Umayyad Caliph. He was
born in Mecca and grew up in Medinah ( both are cities in modern day Saudi Arabia ). Abd al-Malik
was a well-educated man and capable ruler, despite the many political problems that impeded his
rule. Ibn Khaldun states: “Abdul Malik Ibn Marwan is one of the greatest Arab and Muslim Caliphs. He
followed in the footsteps of `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, the Commander of the Believers, in regulating
state affairs.”

In his reign, all important records were translated into Arabic, and for the first time a special
currency for the Muslim world was minted, which led to war with the Byzantine Empire under Justinian
II. The Byzantines were led by Leontios at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692 in Asia Minor and were
decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of Slavs. The Islamic
currency was then made the only currency exchange in the Muslim world. Also, many reforms happened
in his time as regards agriculture and commerce. Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended
it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular postal service.
