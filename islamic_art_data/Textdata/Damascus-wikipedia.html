Damascus is the capital of Syria as well as one of the
country's 14 governorates. The Damascus Governorate is ruled by a governor appointed by the Minister
of Interior. In addition to being widely known as the oldest continuously inhabited city in the

Currently, the city has an estimated population of about 1,669,000. Located in southwestern
Syria, it is the center of a large metropolitan area of 4,8 million people. Geographically
embedded on the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80 km (50 mi) inland from the
eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea on a plateau 680 metres (2,200 ft) above sea-level, Damascus
experiences a semi-arid climate due to the rain shadow effect. The Barada River flows through
Damascus.

First settled in the 2nd millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from
661â€“750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad.
Damascus saw a political decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance
in the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. During Ottoman rule, the city decayed completely while
maintaining a certain cultural prestige. Today, it is the seat of the central government and all of
the government ministries. Damascus was chosen as the 2008 Arab Capital of Culture.
