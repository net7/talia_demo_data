The city lies on the River Arno and is known for its history and its importance in the Middle Ages
and in the Renaissance, especially for its art and architecture. A centre of medieval European trade
and finance and one of the richest and wealthiest cities of the time, Florence is considered the
birthplace of the Italian Renaissance; in fact, it has been called the Athens of the Middle Ages.
It was long under the de facto rule of the Medici family. From 1865 to 1870 the city was also the
capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Florence is often known as the "Jewel of the Renaissance".
The historic centre of Florence attracts millions of tourists each year and was declared a World
Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1982. Florence is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful cities in
the world, and its artistic, historic and cultural heritage and impact in the world remains
vast up to this day. The city has also a major European impact in music, architecture, education,
cuisine, fashion, philosophy, science and religion. The historic centre of Florence contains
numerous elegant squares (piazzas), Renaissance palaces (palazzi), academies, parks, gardens,
churches, monasteries, museums, art galleries and ateliers. The city has also been nominated,
according to a 2007 study, as the most desirable destination for tourists in the world.
The city boasts a wide range of collections of art, especially those held in the Pitti Palace and
the Uffizi, (which receives about 1.6 million tourists a year). Florence is arguably the last
preserved Renaissance city in the world[10] and is regarded by many as the art capital of Italy. It
has been the birthplace or chosen home of many notable historical figures, such as Dante, Boccaccio,
Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Donatello, Galileo
Galilei, Catherine de' Medici, Antonio Meucci, Guccio Gucci, Salvatore Ferragamo, Roberto Cavalli,
and Emilio Pucci.
