Abu Bakr (Abdullah ibn Abi Qahafa) was the Prophet Muhammad's father-in-law, and one
of his closest companions and advisers. Abu Bakr succeeded to the Prophet's political and
administrative functions, thereby initiating the Office of the Caliphate.

Sunni Muslims believe that Abu Bakr was the first male convert to Islam (Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, Muhammad's first wife,
is universally considered the first ever convert) following the commencement of Allah's Revelations
to Muhammad. Upon Muhammad's death he became the first Muslim ruler (632â€“634), regarded in
Sunni Islam as the first of the Rashidun (righteously guided Caliphs).

In Shia Islam, he is,
however, regarded as a usurper and political opportunist. His caliphate lasted two years and three
months, during which time he consolidated the Muslim state. Upon the death of Muhammad, some tribes
rebelled, and in return he fought the Ridda wars against these Arab tribes to establish Islamic rule
over all of Arabia. He also invaded Sassanid Persian and Byzantine Empire conquering the lands of
Syria and Iraq. Abu Bakr is also well known for collecting the verses of the Quran and putting them into the final book read by Muslims today. Many Hafiz (a person who commits
the Quran to memory) had died in the previous wars so he was concerned about the preservation of the
Quran. He also stopped the Quran being translated into different versions of Arabic.
