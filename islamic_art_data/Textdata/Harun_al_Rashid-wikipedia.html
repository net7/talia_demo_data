He ruled from 786 to 809, and his time was marked by scientific, cultural and religious prosperity.
Art and music also flourished significantly during his reign. He established the library Bayt
al-Hikma ("House of Wisdom").
Since Harun was intellectually, politically and militarily resourceful, his life and the court over
which he held sway have been the subject of many tales: some are factual but most are believed to be
fictitious. An example of what is known to be factual is the story of the clock that was among
various presents that Harun had delightfully sent to Charlemagne. The presents were carried by the
returning Frankish mission that came to offer Harun friendship in 799. Charlemagne and his retinue
deemed the clock to be a conjuration for the sounds it emanates and the tricks it displays every
time an hour ticks. Among what is known to be fictional is the famous The Book of One Thousand and
One Nights containing many stories that are fantasized by Harun's magnificent court, and even Harun
al-Rashid himself. The family of Barmakids which played a deciding role in establishing the Abbasid
Caliphate declined gradually during his rule.
