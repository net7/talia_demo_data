Mashhad is the

Now Mashhad is notably known as the resting place of the Imam Reza. A shrine was later built there
to commemorate the Imam, which in turn gave rise to increasing demographic development.
Mashhad is also known as the city of Ferdowsi, the great Persian poet of Shahnameh, which is
considered to be the Persian national epic.
