<P>The Abbasid Caliphate was the third of the Islamic Caliphate of the Islamic Empire. It was
ruled by the Abbasid dynasty of caliphs, who built their capital in
Baghdad, after overthrowing the Umayyad caliphs from all but
al-Andalus. The Abbasid caliphate flourished for two centuries, but
slowly went into decline with the rise to power of the Turkish army
it had created, the Mamluks. Within 150 years of gaining power across
Persia, they were forced to cede power to local dynastic amirs who
only nominally acknowledged their power, and had to cede al-Andalus
to an escaped Umayyad royal and the Maghreb and North Africa to
independent entities. Their rule was briefly ended for three years in
1258, when Hulagu Khan, the Mongol conqueror, sacked Baghdad,
resuming in Egypt in 1261. They continued to claim authority in
religious matters from their base in Egypt up to 1519 when power was
formally transferred to the Ottomans and the capital transferred to
Istanbul. The Islamic Golden Age was inaugurated by the middle of the
8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the
transfer of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad. During this period
the Muslim world became the unrivaled intellectual centre for
science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids
championed the cause of knowledge and established the House of Wisdom
in Baghdad where both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars sought to
translate and gather all the world's knowledge into Arabic. Many
classic works of antiquity that would otherwise have been lost were
translated into Arabic and Persian and later in turn translated into
Turkish, Hebrew and Latin. During this period the Muslim world was a
cauldron of cultures which collected, synthesized and significantly
advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Roman, Chinese,
Indian, Persian, Egyptian, North African, Greek, and Byzantine
civilizations.</P>
