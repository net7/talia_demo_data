<h2>Sandman</h2>
<p>
The Sandman's main character is Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, who is essentially the anthropomorphic manifestation of dreams. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. Gaiman himself has summarized the plot of the series (in the foreword to Endless Nights) as "The Lord of Dreams learns one must change or die and then makes his decision."

The character's initially haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment at the start of the series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.

The story-lines primarily take place in the Dreaming, Morpheus's realm, and the waking world, with occasional visits to other domains, such as Hell, Faerie, Asgard, and the domains of the other Endless. Many used the contemporary United States of America and the United Kingdom as a backdrop. The DC Universe was the official setting of the series, but well-known DC characters and places were rarely featured after 1990, with one exception: Lyta Hall, formerly Fury of the 1980s super-team Infinity Inc., figures prominently in the "Kindly Ones" story arc. John Constantine and Doctor Destiny are also key characters in two of the early issues. And in the final volume, Superman, Batman, Darkseid and the Martian Manhunter all have a very brief cameo.

Most of the storylines take place in modern times (presumably the late 1980s and early 1990s), but many short stories are set in the past, taking advantage of the immortal nature of many of the characters, and deal with historical individuals and events.
