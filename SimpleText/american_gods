<h2>American Gods</h2>
<p>
The book follows the adventures of ex-convict Shadow upon his early release from prison due to the death of his wife, Laura, in a car accident. He is hired by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday to act as an escort and bodyguard, and travels across America visiting Wednesday's colleagues and acquaintances. Gradually, it is revealed that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the All-Father (the word Wednesday is derived from "Odin's (Woden's) day"). Wednesday is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods of ancient mythology, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to participate in an epic battle against the New American Gods, manifestations of modern life and technology (e.g. the internet, media, & modern means of transport).

Mythological characters prominently featured in the book include Odin, Loki, Czernobog, the Zorya, the Norns, Anansi, Eostre, Kali, Thoth, Anubis, Horus, and Bast. In addition to the numerous figures from real-world myths, a few characters from The Sandman and its spinoffs make brief cameos in the book. Other mythological characters featured in the novel are not divine, but are legendary or folk heroes, such as Johnny Appleseed. Shadow himself is implied to be Balder, which is confirmed in the follow-up novella, "Monarch of the Glen". The story also features, in its most erotic chapter, a succubus-like re-invention of the Queen of Sheba, who while posing as a prostitute literally swallows a man through her sexual organs. "Bilquis", as she is called here, is later killed by one of the New Gods. Sexuality as a rule plays a prominent part in the plot and subplots; Mr. Wednesday courts several young women on the journey across America, while Shadow is successfully seduced by a humanoid version of Bast. An exception to the association with sexuality is the Midnight Star of the Zorya, who gives Shadow the moon but does not require a kiss in return.

When the New Gods murder Wednesday – thus galvanizing the Old Gods into action – Shadow obeys Wednesday's order by holding his vigil. This is accomplished by re-enacting the act performed by Odin of hanging from a "World Tree" while pierced by a spear. Shadow eventually perishes and visits the land of the dead, where he is guided by Thoth and judged by Anubis. Eostre later brings him back to life, obeying orders that she does not fully understand. During the period between life and death, Shadow learns that he is Wednesday's son, conceived as part of his plans.

At the climax of the story, Shadow reveals that America is bad "growing ground" for Gods; that the power of gods eventually wanes as long as they spend time in America. Wednesday's attempt to rally the gods is proved to be a deception, in that the deaths of gods on both sides of the war would give Odin the power he lacks. The leader of the New Gods is proved to be Loki, who had secretly been working with Odin to create the "sacrifice of gods" that would generate enough Chaos to empower himself. Shadow's information therefore stops the battle in its tracks.

Thereafter, Shadow visits Iceland, where he meets the original Odin, of whom Wednesday is an incarnation. He accuses Odin of doing that which Wednesday did, only to learn that although Wednesday was Odin, Odin is not Wednesday. Shadow gives Odin Wednesday's glass eye, which Odin puts in place of his original eyepatch.

Various real-life towns and tourist attractions, including the House on the Rock and Rock City, are featured through the course of the book. Gaiman states in an introduction that he has obscured the precise location of some actual locales.

According to Gaiman, American Gods is not based on Diana Wynne Jones's Eight Days of Luke, "although they bear an odd relationship, like second cousins once removed or something." When working on the structure of a story linking gods and days of the week, he realised that this idea had already been used in Eight Days of Luke. He abandoned the story, but later used the character Wednesday and the day of meeting when writing American Gods.
