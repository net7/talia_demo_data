<h2>Carpe Jugulum</h2>
<p>
Count Magpyr and family are invited to the naming of Magrat and King Verence's daughter, to be conducted by the Omnian priest, Mightily Oats. For some reason, the Magpyrs are not keen to go home to Ãœberwald, and, once again, the witches, Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Agnes Nitt (aka Perdita) have to save the mountain realm of Lancre.
</p>
<p>
The Magpyr family have made themselves much more formidable enemies by building up tolerance to the normal methods used to defeat vampires, such as garlic, bright light, and religious symbols. They exert a hypnotic charm over normal people which prevents them from realising that the vampires are taking over Lancre. Only the youngest witch, Agnes, and the Omnian priest, Mightily Oats, seem able to resist this charm, due to their dual personalities. The Magpyr son, Vlad, is attracted to Agnes because she is able to resist him.

There is an Igor who is the servant of the Magpyrs. He is a traditionalist who spends his spare time breeding and distributing spiders for the dark corners of the castle. The Magpyrs are very rude to him, and eventually he rebels.

The vampires identify Granny Weatherwax as one of their more significant foes, and decide to deal with the problem by converting her to one of them.

Other characters from earlier Discworld books who appear in this novel include Death, Hodgesaargh, the Ogg family, and Nanny Ogg's cat, Greebo.

The novel bears certain similarities to Lords and Ladies, such as a celebration (Magrat and Verence's wedding in Lords and Ladies, their daughter's christening in Carpe Jugulum), the intrusion of outsiders with mind-affecting abilities (elves in Lords and Ladies, vampires in Carpe Jugulum), and part of the solution to the conflict being a forgotten member of the outsider faction (the King of the elves in Lords and Ladies, the old Count in Carpe Jugulum).

As is common in Discworld novels, Pratchett references and parodies popular culture frequently, especially Hammer horror and the gothic subculture in this novel.
